    //// This module performs post-register allocation optimizations and cleanups.
    //// It includes tasks such as instruction scheduling, peephole optimizations,
    //// and final adjustments to ensure the generated code is efficient and correct.
    //
    //// Step 1: Instruction Scheduling
    //fn instruction_scheduling() {
    //    // Reorder instructions to minimize stalls and improve pipeline efficiency.
    //    // This may involve moving independent instructions closer together.
    //}
    //
    //// Step 2: Peephole Optimizations
    //fn peephole_optimizations() {
    //    // Look for small patterns of instructions that can be replaced with more efficient sequences.
    //    // Examples include eliminating redundant moves or combining multiple operations into one.
    //}
    //
    //// Step 3: Final Adjustments
    //fn final_adjustments() {
    //    // Ensure that all instructions conform to the target architecture's constraints.
    //    // This may involve adjusting immediate values, fixing up branch targets, etc.
    //}
    //
    //// Execute the steps in order
    //instruction_scheduling();
    //peephole_optimizations();
    //final_adjustments();
